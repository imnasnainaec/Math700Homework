%% Notes: 
%%    1. Write your answers inside a \begin{solution}...\end{solution} environment.
%%
%%    2. If you will use references, insert bibtex reference entries in the file
%%       Math700.bib.  (Create that file if it doesn't yet exist.)
%%
%%    3. If you will use acronyms, please define them in the macros.tex file.
%%
%%    4. Please try to check that your file compiles:
%%
%%       Mac OS X users: you might try MacTeX. 
%%       Windows users: you might try proTeXt. 
%%       Linux users: most come with TeX; otherwise do a full install of TeXLive.
%%
%%       There is a Makefile in this directory, so on Linux you could just 
%%       enter `make` to compile all the Homework*.tex files at once.
%%
%%    5. Please don't hesitate to inform the prof if you have trouble, or open
%%       a ``New issue'' or create a new ``Wiki page'' on GitHub.  Otherwise,
%%       send an email to williamdemeo@gmail.com.
%%
%%    6. It will probably be hard to keep everyone's notation consistent.
%%       For the most basic symbols, we should have some conventions and use
%%       LaTeX macros to keep the conventions consistent and easy to remember.
%%       For example, to denote an algebra,
         \newcommand\alg[1]{\ensuremath{\mathbf{#1}}}
         \newcommand{\<}{\ensuremath{\langle}}
         \renewcommand{\>}{\ensuremath{\rangle}}
%%       So, an algebra in LaTeX is typed as $\alg{A} = \<A, F\>$.
%%       Similarly, for a field, let's use:
         \newcommand\fld[1]{\ensuremath{\mathbb{#1}}}
%%       So, a field in LaTeX is typed as $\fld{F}$.

Let $z_1, \dots, z_n$ be a list of complex
numbers and, for each $1 \leq k \leq n$, 
let $s_k = \sum_{i=1}^k z_i$. For real numbers
$a_1, \dots, a_n$ satisfying 
$a_1 \geq a_2 \geq \cdots \geq a_n \geq 0$, 
show that

\begin{problem}
Write down the definition of a \emph{module} as a (universal) algebra, 
$\alg{M} = \< M, F\>$.  That is, describe the set $F$ of operations and 
give the conditions that they should satisfy in order for $\alg{M}$ to 
agree with the classical definition of a module over a ring.\\[4pt]
[{\it Hint:} Let $\alg{R} = \<R, +, \cdot, -, 0, 1\>$ be a ring and,
  for each $r\in R$, define a scalar multiply operation $f_r \in F$.]

Let $\alg{R} = \<R, +, \cdot, -, 0, 1\>$ be a ring.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Define \emph{left ideal} of $\alg{R}$.
\item Let $\mathscr{A} = \{A_i : i \in \mathscr{I}\}$ be a family of left ideals
of $\alg{R}$.  Prove that $\bigcap \mathscr{A}$ is a left ideal.

\begin{problem}
Let $\alg{R}$ be a ring and fix $a, b \in R$.  Prove that if $1 - ba$ is left
invertible, then $1 - ab$ is also left invertible.  What is the inverse?\\[4pt]
[{\it Hint:} Consider the left ideal $R(1 - ab)$.  It contains the left ideal
  $Rb(1-ab) = Rb$ and therefore contains 1. Verify these statements, then
  try to compute the inverse of $1-ab$, as follow.  (Ask for more hints as needed.)]
